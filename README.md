**1.	Organization of Git Repository**

A git repository with the title of Chat App was created for this project. Regular commits were made to the repository after the completion of a feature for each component. New branches were made for adding features such as adding user to channel or group that were eventually merged after the branch was a success.
    1.	The src folder contains the node application.
    2.	The server folder contains the server information.
    3.	Readme.md contains the information on how to set the project locally.
    4.	All the packages and modules have been saved by using â€“save command to make it easier to set the project locally easily.

**4.	Responsibilities between Client and Server**

    1.	GET: The clients send a get request on initialization of a component to a server. The server returns a json file.
      a.	A get request is sent for getting the user list.
      b.	A get request is sent for getting the group and channel information for the user that has been authenticated. 
      c.	A get request is sent to get all message in a channel.
      d.	A get request is sent to get all users in a group or channel.

    2.	POST: The clients send a post request to the server after any form data is submitted. The client posts the request in as json and the server sends an ok response after success. 
      a.	A post request is sent for authenticating the user.
      b.	A post request is sent for adding a new user.
      c.	A post request is sent to add a new message to a channel.
      d.	A post request is sent to add a user to the group or channel.

    3.	The client also sends a delete request to the user to delete the user from the user list.
      a.	 A delete request is to send to delete a user from the user list.
      
**5.	Interaction between Client components and Server**

    - Login Page Component: After the submission of the user information in the Login Page, the data will be checked and returned true if valid. The auth service will route the page to Group Component with a list of all groups and channels. The username, image, id, and role will be stored in the local storage.

    - Group Add Component: The client will send a post request with a user id and group id and user role to the server. The server will update the extended user json file to add user in the groups list as well as the group json file to add user in the group. Depending upon the role selected it will add the role to the group file as well. The file will be overwritten with new data containing the latest changes. The Group Add component will refresh page with the new member included in the group member list.

    - Channel Add Component: The client will send a post request with a user id and channel id and message to the server. The server will update the group json file to add user in the members of the specified channel of the group. The new data containing the latest changes will overwrite the existing file. The Channel Add component will refresh page with the new member included in the channel member list.

    - Message Component: The client will send a post request containing the channel id, message, and the user id. The server will append the new message to the list of messages for a specific channel. The changes will be saved in the json file. The page will refresh to get the new list of messages. The new message will be displayed in the current component. 

    - User Component: The client will send a post request containing the information of the new user. The server will update both the user and extended user json file with the user information. The User Component will reload with the new user in the list.
